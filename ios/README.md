## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the
Example directory first.

## Requirements

For some users, the ruby version has been a sticking point, but we recommend:

```
rvm use 2.7.6
```

Cocoapods will require `CFPropertyList` to be installed as well.

```
gem install CFPropertyList
```

## Installation

Trifle is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To
install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Trifle'
```
